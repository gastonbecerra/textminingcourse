UK's growing medical tech sector looks to be in rude health

BYLINE: Andrew Ward in London

LENGTH: 822 words


What do you get if you cross a Golden Triangle with a Silicon Roundabout? A
growing band of UK entrepreneurs hope the answer will be a globally competitive
hub for innovation in ""digital health"".

Companies operating at the intersection of technology and medical science are
attracting increasing attention -- and finance -- as the digital revolution that
has reshaped sectors such as retail and banking begins to transform healthcare.

As in other areas, the US west coast has led the way with companies including
Fitbit, the maker of wearable fitness monitors, but the UK south-east is aiming
to give California a run for its money.

Cambridge Cognition, a Cambridge-based developer of cognitive testing
technology, this week said it was working with London-based Ctrl Group on
wearable devices that could detect signs of dementia and depression by tracking
changes in people's everyday behaviour.

This was just the latest example of convergence between London's thriving
""Silicon Roundabout"" tech cluster and the ""Golden Triangle"" of scientific
research between Oxford, Cambridge and the capital.

Healthcare apps battle to be taken seriously

BYLINE: Andrew Jack

LENGTH: 959 words


If the vibrancy of an industry is judged by its output, digital health apps are
thriving. When assessed instead by uptake and value, progress appears more
hesitant.

On the Apple store alone, there are now more than 165,000 health-related apps
available, offering everything from early stage prevention to advanced medical
consultation and monitoring. Yet just 5 per cent register any significant number
of downloads.

""There's something new every day,"" says Karen Taylor, director of the UK centre
for health solutions at Deloitte. ""But I think there is a degree of hype. It's
difficult to pull out the reality.""

There is little doubt about the underlying trend, and capacity, for digital
health services. The fast-growing reach of the internet, big data analysis and
ever wider availability of smartphones has provided expanding access to more
sophisticated tools and information. A study by BCC Research estimated that by
2018, the mobile health industry overall would be worth $21.5bn.

The technological capacity of such services offers speed, convenience, anonymity
and potentially greater effectiveness. The trend towards ""gamefication"" and
nudging in order to gently change individual behaviours provides new approaches
and motivations which are increasingly being tapped in health.

A poll in February by PwC concluded that ""people are demanding more convenient
care, more access and a bigger say in decisions about them and their care ...
They're willing to have their care in non-traditional settings, from
non-traditional players.""

Brian Pomering, a PwC partner specialising in healthcare, says: ""I think we're
getting to a critical turning point where citizens are not going to accept the
status quo.""

The majority of health-related apps and online services focus on prevention:
systems to inspire, encourage and monitor healthier lifestyles, led by fitness,
wellness and nutrition. Many incorporate movement indicators, allowing
effortless monitoring of distance walked or heights climbed.

A newer twist has come in ""brain health"", with tools such as  Peak, designed to
stimulate improvements in memory, numerical and verbal reasoning; or  Wizard, to
help the memory in people with schizophrenia. More broadly, services such as the
Big White Wall provide a way to express concerns about depression and seek
support. Others offer cognitive behavioural therapy.

Other types of health app assist with medicines, home monitoring of medical
conditions and sharing of information, which can help with diagnosis, offer
guidance and assistance, and even be tapped to help recruitment into clinical
trials. The growing use of artificial intelligence -- such as  IBM's Watson --
offers far greater scope for diagnosis and treatment in the future.

Uncertainties lie ahead. One question is how far many health apps measure the
right things. As a report from the Vitality Institute, a think-tank within the
South African health insurance company Discovery, cautioned this month: ""Despite
the benefits to health of such interventions, companies ... often entirely
neglect to integrate scientific or behavioural evidence into their devices.""

The UK's National Health Service has responded with a library showcasing health
apps. The European Commission is exploring the prospect of establishing
""kitemarks"" of quality for apps.

Another concern is whether devices measure reliably. Integrated movement
indicators, for instance, will only work so long as the wearer is attached to
them. They are open to manipulation for those seeking to overstate their
physical activity -- a temptation in the case of apps linked to incentives
offered by health insurers and other providers.

The US Food and Drug Administration has stepped up regulatory scrutiny of apps
which directly affect patients. Among services requiring its approval are apps
that monitor heart wave function irregularities, emit light used for examining
patients and control medical devices and machinery.

One factor prompting worry among doctors is whether self diagnosis risks
triggering greater misdiagnosis. ""Who has clinical responsibility if something
goes wrong?"" asks Mr Pomering. ""People can always find the worst and rarest of
rare diseases in themselves, and miss things.""

There is also the matter of how far apps reach those most in need. While
smartphones are increasingly widespread even in lower income countries, people
with access and who are motivated to use health apps are often those who are
less in need. The focus on consumer health products for people who are healthy
may need to be shifted to devices that actually help the sick and assist
healthcare professionals.

A report by the Nuffield Trust in February argued: ""To date, there has been a
real focus on apps and devices to improve wellness -- such as step and calorie
counters -- as well as those focused on a single disease. There has been less of
a focus on tools for complex costly patients.""

Privacy is an important issue. While few cases of the misuse of personal health
data have been identified -- leading to discrimination in health insurance or
employment -- there are calls for more transparency and tougher standards of
encryption and for the removal of personal identities from sensitive
information.

An NHS health apps library survey last year showed two-thirds of apps which sent
identifying information over the internet did not use encryption. There were an
estimated 7,000 data breaches in the NHS in 2011-14.

""The genie is out of the bottle,"" says Ms Taylor at Deloitte, nonetheless, on
the subject of app use. ""Even if there is scepticism among health providers and
disadvantages, patients want to use them, are asking about them and buying them
themselves.""

Providers, healthcare professionals and regulators will have to adapt.

Big data analysis to transform insurance industry

BYLINE: Eduardo Llull

LENGTH: 832 words


Big data analysis has revolutionised many areas of modern life -- from
healthcare, to politics, to sport -- yet not so far the property insurance
market. That looks set to change.

""The insurance industry has been a little of a hold out,"" says Lori Sherer, head
of the advanced analytics practice at management consultancy Bain, but ""is now
on the brink of innovation"".

More executives at property insurers -- who worry about tight profit margins and
growing competition -- plan to take advantage of the potential benefits of the
increasing amounts of captured data.

From weather patterns to social media, new sources of data could help them
streamline costs, be more targeted with the risks they want to underwrite,
identify new customers, predict fraud or identify which claims have the
potential to become very expensive.

Property insurance executives have ""fairly aggressive plans"" for developing big
data analysis over the next couple of years, says Klayton Southwood, director of
risk consulting at Willis Towers Watson. He cites the results of a survey the
consultancy conducted in the US last year.

If what the executives say in the survey holds true, the property insurance
industry is soon to be significantly changed by its approach to  big data.

For example, fewer than half of the property and casualty insurance executives
who took part in the survey reported that big data and the analysis of it help
them now with pricing, underwriting and risk selection. On the other hand, just
over three-quarters of the survey respondents expect big data to help them in
this area in two years' time.

The survey suggests more management teams expect to gather data from a greater
number of sources. These include data generated through website use, email and
phone calls -- and social media.

One emerging area of increasing interest to property insurers for generating
data and serving customers is the smart home. This refers to household devices
and systems -- from doorbells to air conditioning -- that produce data and can
be controlled from anywhere by computer or mobile device.

Two US-based providers, Liberty Mutual Insurance and American Family Insurance,
have partnered with Nest Labs, the smart-home tech company that Google acquired
in 2014, to offer its smoke alarm and carbon monoxide monitor, Nest Protect, to
customers for free. As part of the deal, customers can receive a discount from
the insurers on their premiums and the insurers in return receive data from the
device.

The data shared with the insurer are limited and include the status of
batteries, sensors and internet connection as well as the location of the house
and the room in which the device is located.

Data produced by customers are already used in other areas of insurance, such as
car coverage, where telematics that monitor driving style help cut premiums for
safe drivers. They are also used in retail, where supermarkets issue loyalty
cards and offer discounts in exchange for data on customers' shopping habits.

John Davies, managing director of risk finance at broker Marsh, says customers
will typically give up personal information under two conditions: if it is easy
to do so and if they receive something in return. ""In the insurance industry,""
he says, ""it's still not easy.""

Some information can be gathered without customers knowing and social media have
made this much easier. Using sites such as Facebook and Twitter, insurers can
get a better understanding of their customers' behaviour and risk profile.

The more insurers mine and use data, the more likely it is to become an area for
regulators to address. Officials at the Switzerland-based International
Association of Insurance Supervisors are discussing how insurers are using data
in order to determine if the organisation should provide guidance.

In November, the UK's Financial Conduct Authority requested information on how
insurers are using big data. It aims to publish its findings by mid-2016 and
reveal its plans on what response it will make. This could include ""a market
study, adjustments to policy or guidance or another form of intervention,""
according to its website.

Data protection laws in many countries put some limit on what insurers can do.
That does not mean, however, that insurance executives are paying attention as
much as they might.

""There are differences at different companies with how seriously they take data
protection,"" says Emma Bate, partner at international law firm DAC Beachcroft.
""This needs to be discussed at the board level.""

Regulatory and legal risks aside, one of the biggest challenges facing property
insurers is making sure they have the right people with the right skills to
capture and analyse big data properly. Respondents to the Willis Towers Watson
survey ranked this as the top big-data challenge.

""Big data can be paralysing,"" says Helen Gemmell, catastrophe modelling manager
at Liberty Specialty Markets. ""Asking the wrong questions of it or using the
data in isolation can lead to poor decisions.""

Insurance and the big data technology revolution

BYLINE: Oliver Ralph

LENGTH: 2221 words


Automatic razors, jet packs and traffic jams on the skyways. The Jetsons made
all sorts of predictions about life in the distant future. But the Hanna-Barbera
cartoon, made in the 1960s and 1980s, skipped over the question of insurance.

That is hardly surprising. Risk management is rarely a popular topic in science
fiction. And in any case, the insurance industry has not always been quick to
pick up on new technology. ""The entire industry is focused on how life was lived
five or 10 years ago,"" says Andrew Brem, chief digital officer at Aviva.

He is not the only one who feels that way. In a recent survey of insurers by
broker Willis Towers Watson, 74 per cent of respondents felt the industry had
failed to show leadership in digital innovation.

But change is coming as the industry wakes up to the idea that the cover we
might buy 20 years from now will look very different from the cover we need
today.

Big insurance companies are pouring millions into innovation and research. Mr

Digital disrupters take big pharma 'beyond the pill'

BYLINE: Sarah Neville in London

LENGTH: 1832 words


After Maggie Philyaw developed Type 2 diabetes, she found solace not in the
medicines of the pharmaceutical industry, but the technology of Silicon Valley.
Two years ago, her then employer in North Carolina signed Ms Philyaw up to a
programme run by  Livongo Health, a California-based start-up, which gave her a
device, smaller than an iPhone and fitted with a cellular chip, that keeps track
of her blood sugar levels.

Using the latest advances in cloud computing, the drop of blood she draws each
day is instantly analysed, and a text telling her what to do -- ""drink two
glasses of water and walk for 15 minutes"" -- is sent if her readings place her
in the danger zone. At the press of a button she can also access further help
over the telephone from her ""coach"", a highly qualified dietitian who has
managed her own  diabetes for more than 40 years.

For the titans of big pharma, Ms Philyaw represents omen and opportunity, as a
disruptive breed of digital innovator becomes the access point to healthcare for
hundreds of thousands of patients and threatens to undermine the industry's
decades-old business model. Big pharma has long focused on the lucrative
business of drug development, supported by armies of sales people deployed to
persuade physicians to choose its medicines.

But emerging digital technologies are reshaping the landscape. A new generation
of companies is using big data, sensors and artificial intelligence to provide
precise real-time monitoring of patients, especially those suffering from
conditions such as diabetes and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, which are
imposing a daunting burden on overstretched health budgets.

As a result of the products and services these companies are developing, a
patient's primary point of contact with the health system can sometimes now be a
remote monitoring centre, or disembodied voice on the telephone, instead of a
doctor's office.

""Rather than buying a pill, [insurers or employers] might buy an overall
solution for diabetes,"" says Tom Main, a partner in 7wire Ventures, a venture
capital fund that led the first round of investment in Livongo. ""And that's a
very different framework for pharma.""

Now retired from her job as a registered nurse, Ms Philyaw pays $50 a month for
Livongo's service and lives free of medication. She counts her coach Toby
Smithson, whom she has never met but who has offered practical and psychological
support, as her most frequent point of contact with the health system.

""I have a good relationship with my physician but I feel I speak with [Ms
Smithson] more often,"" she says. ""Having a coach has contributed to fewer doctor
visits and less money spent that way. I feel that she really cares if I make it
or meet my goals [on diet and exercise]"", she adds.

***

Glen Tullman, chief executive of Livongo, says as recently as three years ago
the technology underpinning his company did not exist. But corporate America,
which is a major provider of health insurance, is taking notice. More than half
the companies in the Fortune 100 are working with Livongo and it is eyeing
expansion into Europe, Asia and Canada.

Investors are starting to bet heavily on the potential of technological
innovation to transform the way healthcare is delivered. According to Rock
Health, a venture fund dedicated to  digital health, a total of $4.2bn was
invested in the sector last year, with companies in the analytics and big data
category attracting $341m over 22 deals, more than doubled from 2015.

However the pharma industry will have to grapple with its own entrenched culture
if it is to take advantage of the expansion in digital technologies.

Stefan Biesdorf, who leads McKinsey's digital pharma and medical technology work
in Europe, says the margins achieved by a digital health business are small
compared with those associated with a blockbuster drug, making it harder to
build a commercial case for investment. Moreover, the never-ending cycle of
tweaks and upgrades through which a digital device passes is foreign to an
industry that will wait more than a decade to get a drug from bench to bedside
-- but expects to make no further changes once it has secured regulatory
approval.

Nor is the industry well placed to exploit a new healthcare universe that
requires an ability to build lasting bonds with consumers. He cites as an
example  mySugr, a Vienna-based company that uses a similar blend of technology,
combined with on-demand support, to collect data directly from consumers.

""It only has 50 employees but it has much, much, more in-depth understanding of
patient behaviour in diabetes than probably some of the largest diabetes
companies, or insulin producers, in the world,"" says Mr Biesdorf.

Joe Jimenez, chief executive of Novartis, the Swiss drugmaker that is widely
seen as the leader among big pharma companies on digital health, concedes that
the industry has been ""slow to adopt some of the digital technologies, compared
to other industries"" and recognises ""a risk that some of these digital start-ups
'own' the relationship with the physician and the patient and they distance the
pharmaceutical company from that"".

However, Mr Jimenez, a former Heinz executive whose background is in the fast
moving world of retail, says the industry is adopting digital technologies ""at
an accelerated rate"", and argues that they can boast a base of knowledge the
digital minnows cannot rival.

""I do believe that large pharma companies have an advantage, not on the agility
side but definitely on what they know about disease states, about patients,
about the entire healthcare system, and many of the start-ups don't have that
experience,"" he says.

Mr Jimenez adds that the digital exemplars are ""definitely either potential
competitors or they will become partners"".

A flurry of deals in recent years shows that some pharma groups are racing to
boost digital capability, by buying companies that offer ready-made expertise,
or entering into partnerships as they seek to offer services ""beyond the pill"".

Teva Pharmaceuticals showed the way in 2015 when it announced it was buying
Gecko Health Innovations for an undisclosed sum. The lure was Gecko's main
product, CareTRx, a platform to help chronic sufferers from respiratory disease,
which combines a sensor device that connects to most inhalers with a data
analytics function.

Meanwhile, the French drugmaker Sanofi recently  joined forces with Verily Life
Sciences to work on devices and patient support for diabetics, and Pfizer is
working with IBM Watson as part of its work on immuno-oncology, using its
expertise in data analytics to identify new drug targets.

Erik Nordkamp, the UK head of Pfizer, says the future of healthcare will involve
""a convergence of technologies to come to better solutions"".

Technology is the tool to spur a healthcare revolution

BYLINE: John Thornhill

LENGTH: 725 words


The malware attack on Britain's National Health Service is hardly the best
advertisement for digitising healthcare. Those hospitals that had to cancel
operations and revert to pen and paper are unlikely to clamour for putting more
medical records and services online.

But if we want to address the spiralling costs of healthcare we may have no
alternative but to invest in smarter -- and more secure -- technology.
Healthcare systems desperately need a productivity revolution. Technology offers
our best hope of achieving better outcomes at lower cost.

In many countries, healthcare systems are imploding under spending pressures
like so many collapsing lungs. But the demands on healthcare will only rise as
societies age. And, as we have seen in the debate over Obamacare in the US, the
politics of healthcare are often toxic, complicating reform.

Healthcare systems are also riddled with market flaws that baffle those from
other industries. Historically, providers have focused more on inputs than
outcomes. They often prioritise their own convenience over their patients'
needs. As the sick joke goes: the operation was successful, unfortunately the
patient died.

The global mantra is that we must move towards value-based healthcare in which
three Ps are critical: prevention, precision and personalisation. Technology can
help address all three challenges, particularly through the smart use of big
data and  artificial intelligence.

Lloyd Minor, dean of Stanford University School of Medicine, is convinced that
healthcare needs the same kind of consumer revolution that has transformed so
many other sectors of the economy. ""You can engage and empower people with
tech,"" he says.

Any patient can use Google to find out more about the symptoms of a rare
clinical ear disorder that Mr Minor discovered (superior semicircular canal
dehiscence syndrome) than a family practitioner can glean from the medical
records system. Can doctors not make greater use of many of the technologies
they so readily use at home?

Sensors, smartphone apps and data analytics allow more primary care to be
delivered online through services such as ClickWell. They can also enable
""ageing in place"", in which the elderly can be carefully monitored in their own
homes rather than taking up costly places in care homes.

""One of the things that is truly transformational is big data. We can use
electronic systems to deliver better care,"" Mr Minor says. One of the hottest
courses at his school is biomedical data science.

How AI can be further applied to the sector was the subject of the Light Forum,
hosted by the machine learning start-up Roam Analytics, at Stanford last week.

The forum's recurring themes were that new technologies could help people take
more responsibility for their own health, cut waste in the system and enable us
to track the cost-effectiveness of more personalised treatments over time.

Jeff Kindler, former chairman and chief executive of Pfizer, said that for too
long pharmaceuticals companies had been throwing ""darts in the dark"". But more
robust machine learning and AI systems could help identify the most efficient
drugs. ""The real innovators will be rewarded and the others will be losers,"" he
said.

Turning theory into practice will prove a tough task, though. Some healthcare
providers have been burnt by catastrophic attempts to install over-engineered IT
systems. Electronic medical records companies have sometimes deliberately
designed systems to prevent easy data-sharing, locking users into their
services. Many private healthcare providers hoard proprietary data because of
its commercial value.

In Europe, public health systems are understandably reluctant to turn patient
data over to profitmaking private companies. Privacy concerns also prevent the
widespread pooling of data even if almost all of it can be anonymised.

Hans-Georg Eichler, senior medical officer at the European Medical Agency, said
the biggest obstacle to realising the fruits of technology would be the lack of
sufficient data. Some European patients were happy to contribute their data for
the collective good knowing it was invaluable for research. But that attitude
was far from common.

""No data, no drugs is an extremist position but I share it,"" Mr Eichler said.

We desperately need a broader debate about what constitutes safe and appropriate
data donation.

Pharma turns to big data to gauge care and pricing

BYLINE: Sarah Neville, Global Pharmaceuticals Editor

LENGTH: 1336 words


After many years building successful technology businesses, Jeremy Sohn never
imagined that at 43 he would find himself on the payroll of a big pharmaceutical
company.

But 18 months ago he was appointed global head of digital business development
and licensing at Swiss drugmaker Novartis. His appointment is evidence of how an
industry, slow to respond to the disruption of digitisation, is grasping its
importance as it confronts  pricing pressures, ever-vaster quantities of patient
data and more empowered consumers.

Digitisation is changing the way pharma interacts with payers, doctors and
patients, leading drugmakers to seek out different skills and personality traits
in employees.

Germany's Merck last year appointed 30-year-old James Kugler as its first chief
digital officer, with a degree in biomedical engineering and a tech background.
Boehringer Ingelheim, Europe's biggest private drugmaker, hired Simone Menne as
chief financial officer from airline Lufthansa. She is in charge of a new
digital ""lab"", recruiting data specialists and software developers.

Mr Sohn, whose role at Novartis includes overseeing venture capital investments
in technology companies -- a growing trend in Big Pharma -- says that working
alongside highly qualified scientists, he ""typically feels like the dumbest
person in any meeting"". However, he and other external recruits have brought
mindsets that are helping the group evolve from a pure science company into ""a
data [and] technology company"", he adds.

According to Steven Baert, head of human resources, Novartis is starting to reap
considerable benefits from digital investments, particularly in the speed and
efficiency with which it can test medicines.

He says: ""We're already seeing how real-time data capture can help analyse
patient populations and demographics, to make it easier to recruit patients for
clinical trials, and how real-time data-capture devices, like connected sensors
and patient engagement apps, are helping to create remote clinical trials that
aren't site-dependent.""

In the past five years, these changes have been visible in Novartis's workforce.
While staffing overall has risen by just over 20 per cent, the salesforce -- the
traditional bedrock of pharma companies, and their combined $1tn in global
revenues -- has increased by just 13 per cent.

At the same time the number employed in ""market access"" -- negotiating prices
with payers, whether governments or insurers -- has risen up to five times
faster than the average growth rate and now stands at 1,100.

Novartis employs more than 1,200 dual-qualified mathematicians and engineers to
analyse big data sets and calculate the value of new drugs -- for instance,
their potential to reduce hospitalisations and so cut costs. As recently as six
years ago, not a single one was on the payroll.

Behind these changes lie two key shifts. The first is the determination of
cash-constrained global health systems to secure better value from the drugs
they buy.

The second is the advance of digital technology, which is increasingly playing a
role in how patients manage their conditions and companies communicate the
benefits of their medicines to doctors. GlaxoSmithKline, for example, employs
more than 50 people to run webinars with physicians -- a ""multichannel media
team"" that did not exist five years ago.

The UK drugmaker has begun hiring astrophysicists to work in research and
development, keen to deploy their ability to visualise huge data sets. The
company says these qualities are specially important as it seeks to use
artificial intelligence to help spot patterns and connections amid a mass of
information.

At Boehringer, senior executives say that this level of disruption calls for
agility and entrepreneurialism in employees -- which in some cases may be better
found outside the life sciences sector.

Andreas Neumann, head of HR, explains that, although new CFO Ms Menne had ""no
clue"" about pharma, she had worked in a sector that had faced substantial
upheaval.

""She has significant experience in an industry which is under tremendous cost
pressure and has gone through a tremendous amount of change. And you can learn
from that experience, as a company.""

US-based Pfizer last year recognised this new landscape by establishing a
division to bring together health economists; researchers measuring the outcomes
produced by different medicines; and market access specialists. Previously these
groups had been spread throughout the organisation.

Andy Schmeltz, who heads the division, gives the example of Eliquis, an
anticoagulant produced with Bristol-Myers Squibb. Data analysts processed ""real
world"" evidence -- derived from patients going about their normal lives, rather
than taking part in a carefully managed trial -- that suggested it was more cost
effective than the long-established anticoagulant, Warfarin.

Underpinning this work is a massive repository of data, from sources such as
electronic medical records, that covers ""over 300m lives"", says Mr Schmeltz.

This, he says, ""enables us to query the database and generate insights, even
when we're just trying to figure out the design of a trial and the feasibility
of recruitment; are there enough patients out there that meet certain entry
criteria? It enables us to make better decisions on clinical trial development.
It also enables us to model different outcomes across different diseases.""

At Merck, chief executive Stefan Oschmann enthuses about its new breed of
digitally savvy employee, led by ""forward-thinking"" Mr Kugler. ""We're working on
stuff like the connected lab,"" he says, ""a laboratory where everything, every
container, every machine, every pipette, is smart and connected and captures
data automatically"

The sugar conspiracy;
In 1972, a British scientist sounded the alarm that sugar - and not fat - was
the greatest danger to our health. But his findings were ridiculed and his
reputation ruined. How did the world's top nutrition scientists get it so wrong
for so long?

Robert Lustig is a paediatric endocrinologist at the University of California
who specialises in the treatment of childhood obesity. A 90-minute talk he gave
in 2009, titled Sugar: The Bitter Truth, has now been viewed more than six
million times on YouTube. In it, Lustig argues forcefully that fructose, a form
of sugar ubiquitous in modern diets, is a ""poison"" culpable for America's
obesity epidemic.

A year or so before the video was posted, Lustig gave a similar talk to a
conference of biochemists in Adelaide, Australia. Afterwards, a scientist in the
audience approached him. Surely, the man said, you've read Yudkin. Lustig shook
his head. John Yudkin, said the scientist, was a British professor of nutrition
who had sounded the alarm on sugar back in 1972, in a book called Pure, White,
and Deadly.

""If only a small fraction of what we know about the effects of sugar were to be
revealed in relation to any other material used as a food additive,"" wrote
Yudkin, ""that material would promptly be banned."" The book did well, but Yudkin
paid a high price for it. Prominent nutritionists combined with the food
industry to destroy his reputation, and his career never recovered. He died, in
1995, a disappointed, largely forgotten man.

Perhaps the Australian scientist intended a friendly warning. Lustig was
certainly putting his academic reputation at risk when he embarked on a
high-profile campaign against sugar. But, unlike Yudkin, Lustig is backed by a
prevailing wind. We read almost every week of new research into the deleterious
effects of sugar on our bodies. In the US, the latest edition of the
government's official dietary guidelines includes a cap on sugar consumption. In
the UK, the chancellor George Osborne has announced a new tax on sugary drinks.
Sugar has become dietary enemy number one.

This represents a dramatic shift in priority. For at least the last three
decades, the dietary arch-villain has been saturated fat. When Yudkin was
conducting his research into the effects of sugar, in the 1960s, a new
nutritional orthodoxy was in the process of asserting itself. Its central tenet
was that a healthy diet is a low-fat diet. Yudkin led a diminishing band of
dissenters who believed that sugar, not fat, was the more likely cause of
maladies such as obesity, heart disease and diabetes. But by the time he wrote
his book, the commanding heights of the field had been seized by proponents of
the fat hypothesis. Yudkin found himself fighting a rearguard action, and he was
defeated.

Not just defeated, in fact, but buried. When Lustig returned to California, he
searched for Pure, White and Deadly in bookstores and online, to no avail.
Eventually, he tracked down a copy after submitting a request to his university
library. On reading Yudkin's introduction, he felt a shock of recognition.

""Holy crap,"" Lustig thought. ""This guy got there 35 years before me.""

* * *

In 1980, after long consultation with some of America's most senior nutrition
scientists, the US government issued its first Dietary Guidelines. The
guidelines shaped the diets of hundreds of millions of people. Doctors base
their advice on them, food companies develop products to comply with them. Their
influence extends beyond the US. In 1983, the UK government issued advice that
closely followed the American example.

The most prominent recommendation of both governments was to cut back on
saturated fats and cholesterol (this was the first time that the public had been
advised to eat less of something, rather than enough of everything). Consumers
dutifully obeyed. We replaced steak and sausages with pasta and rice, butter
with margarine and vegetable oils, eggs with muesli, and milk with low-fat milk
or orange juice. But instead of becoming healthier, we grew fatter and sicker.

Look at a graph of postwar obesity rates and it becomes clear that something
changed after 1980. In the US, the line rises very gradually until, in the early
1980s, it takes off like an aeroplane. Just 12% of Americans were obese in 1950,
15% in 1980, 35% by 2000. In the UK, the line is flat for decades until the
mid-1980s, at which point it also turns towards the sky. Only 6% of Britons were
obese in 1980. In the next 20 years that figure more than trebled. Today, two
thirds of Britons are either obese or overweight, making this the fattest
country in the EU. Type 2 diabetes, closely related to obesity, has risen in
tandem in both countries.

At best, we can conclude that the official guidelines did not achieve their
objective; at worst, they led to a decades-long health catastrophe. Naturally,
then, a search for culprits has ensued. Scientists are conventionally apolitical
figures, but these days, nutrition researchers write editorials and books that
resemble liberal activist tracts, fizzing with righteous denunciations of ""big
sugar"" and fast food. Nobody could have predicted, it is said, how the food
manufacturers would respond to the injunction against fat - selling us low-fat
yoghurts bulked up with sugar, and cakes infused with liver-corroding transfats.

Nutrition scientists are angry with the press for distorting their findings,
politicians for failing to heed them, and the rest of us for overeating and
under-exercising. In short, everyone - business, media, politicians, consumers -
is to blame. Everyone, that is, except scientists.

We replaced steak and sausages with pasta and rice, butter with margarine, eggs
with muesli. But we still grew fatter

But it was not impossible to foresee that the vilification of fat might be an
error. Energy from food comes to us in three forms: fat, carbohydrate, and
protein. Since the proportion of energy we get from protein tends to stay
stable, whatever our diet, a low-fat diet effectively means a high-carbohydrate
diet. The most versatile and palatable carbohydrate is sugar, which John Yudkin
had already circled in red. In 1974, the UK medical journal, the Lancet, sounded
a warning about the possible consequences of recommending reductions in dietary
fat: ""The cure should not be worse than the disease.""

Still, it would be reasonable to assume that Yudkin lost this argument simply
because, by 1980, more evidence had accumulated against fat than against sugar.

After all, that's how science works, isn't it?

* * *

If, as seems increasingly likely,  the nutritional advice on which we have
relied for 40 years was profoundly flawed, this is not a mistake that can be
laid at the door of corporate ogres. Nor can it be passed off as innocuous
scientific error. What happened to John Yudkin belies that interpretation. It
suggests instead that this is something the scientists did to themselves - and,
consequently, to us.

We tend to think of heretics as contrarians, individuals with a compulsion to
flout conventional wisdom. But sometimes a heretic is simply a mainstream
thinker who stays facing the same way while everyone around him turns 180
degrees. When, in 1957, John Yudkin first floated his hypothesis that sugar was
a hazard to public health, it was taken seriously, as was its proponent. By the
time Yudkin retired, 14 years later, both theory and author had been
marginalised and derided. Only now is Yudkin's work being returned,
posthumously, to the scientific mainstream.

These sharp fluctuations in Yudkin's stock have had little to do with the
scientific method, and a lot to do with the unscientific way in which the field
of nutrition has conducted itself over the years. This story, which has begun to
emerge in the past decade, has been brought to public attention largely by
sceptical outsiders rather than eminent nutritionists. In her painstakingly
researched book, The Big Fat Surprise, the journalist Nina Teicholz traces the
history of the proposition that saturated fats cause heart disease, and reveals
the remarkable extent to which its progress from controversial theory to
accepted truth was driven, not by new evidence, but by the influence of a few
powerful personalities, one in particular.

Teicholz's book also describes how an establishment of senior nutrition
scientists, at once insecure about its medical authority and vigilant for
threats to it, consistently exaggerated the case for low-fat diets, while
turning its guns on those who offered evidence or argument to the contrary. John
Yudkin was only its first and most eminent victim.

Today, as nutritionists struggle to comprehend a health disaster they did not
predict and may have precipitated, the field is undergoing a painful period of
re-evaluation. It is edging away from prohibitions on cholesterol and fat, and
hardening its warnings on sugar, without going so far as to perform a reverse
turn. But its senior members still retain a collective instinct to malign those
who challenge its tattered conventional wisdom too loudly, as Teicholz is now
discovering.

* * *

To understand how we arrived at this point, we need to go back almost to the
beginning of modern nutrition science.

On 23 September, 1955, US President Dwight Eisenhower suffered a heart attack.
Rather than pretend it hadn't happened, Eisenhower insisted on making details of
his illness public. The next day, his chief physician, Dr Paul Dudley White,
gave a press conference at which he instructed Americans on how to avoid heart
disease: stop smoking, and cut down on fat and cholesterol. In a follow-up
article, White cited the research of a nutritionist at the University of
Minnesota, Ancel Keys.

Heart disease, which had been a relative rarity in the 1920s, was now felling
middle-aged men at a frightening rate, and Americans were casting around for
cause and cure. Ancel Keys provided an answer: the ""diet-heart hypothesis"" (for
simplicity's sake, I am calling it the ""fat hypothesis""). This is the idea, now
familiar, that an excess of saturated fats in the diet, from red meat, cheese,
butter, and eggs, raises cholesterol, which congeals on the inside of coronary
arteries, causing them to harden and narrow, until the flow of blood is
staunched and the heart seizes up.

Ancel Keys was brilliant, charismatic, and combative. A friendly colleague at
the University of Minnesota described him as, ""direct to the point of bluntness,
critical to the point of skewering""; others were less charitable. He exuded
conviction at a time when confidence was most welcome. The president, the
physician and the scientist formed a reassuring chain of male authority, and the
notion that fatty foods were unhealthy started to take hold with doctors, and
the public. (Eisenhower himself cut saturated fats and cholesterol from his diet
altogether, right up until his death, in 1969, from heart disease.)

Many scientists, especially British ones, remained sceptical. The most prominent
doubter was John Yudkin, then the UK's leading nutritionist. When Yudkin looked
at the data on heart disease, he was struck by its correlation with the
consumption of sugar, not fat. He carried out a series of laboratory experiments
on animals and humans, and observed, as others had before him, that sugar is
processed in the liver, where it turns to fat, before entering the bloodstream.

He noted, too, that while humans have always been carnivorous, carbohydrates
only became a major component of their diet 10,000 years ago, with the advent of
mass agriculture. Sugar - a pure carbohydrate, with all fibre and nutrition
stripped out - has been part of western diets for just 300 years; in
evolutionary terms, it is as if we have, just this second, taken our first dose
of it. Saturated fats, by contrast, are so intimately bound up with our
evolution that they are abundantly present in breast milk. To Yudkin's thinking,
it seemed more likely to be the recent innovation, rather than the prehistoric
staple, making us sick.

Today, nutritionists struggle to comprehend a health disaster they did not
predict and may have precipitated

John Yudkin was born in 1910, in the East End of London. His parents were
Russian Jews who settled in England after fleeing the pogroms of 1905. Yudkin's
father died when he was six, and his mother brought up her five sons in poverty.
By way of a scholarship to a local grammar school in Hackney, Yudkin made it to
Cambridge. He studied biochemistry and physiology, before taking up medicine.
After serving in the Royal Army Medical Corps during the second world war,
Yudkin was made a professor at Queen Elizabeth College in London, where he built
a department of nutrition science with an international reputation.

Ancel Keys was intensely aware that Yudkin's sugar hypothesis posed an
alternative to his own. If Yudkin published a paper, Keys would excoriate it,
and him. He called Yudkin's theory ""a mountain of nonsense"", and accused him of
issuing ""propaganda"" for the meat and dairy industries. ""Yudkin and his
commercial backers are not deterred by the facts,"" he said. ""They continue to
sing the same discredited tune."" Yudkin never responded in kind. He was a
mild-mannered man, unskilled in the art of political combat.

Related:  Fat guidelines lacked solid scientific evidence, study concludes

That made him vulnerable to attack, and not just from Keys. The British Sugar
Bureau dismissed Yudkin's claims about sugar as ""emotional assertions""; the
World Sugar Research Organisation called his book ""science fiction"". In his
prose, Yudkin is fastidiously precise and undemonstrative, as he was in person.
Only occasionally does he hint at how it must have felt to have his life's work
besmirched, as when he asks the reader, ""Can you wonder that one sometimes
becomes quite despondent about whether it is worthwhile trying to do scientific
research in matters of health?""

Throughout the 1960s, Keys accumulated institutional power. He secured places
for himself and his allies on the boards of the most influential bodies in
American healthcare, including the American Heart Association and the National
Institutes of Health. From these strongholds, they directed funds to like-minded
researchers, and issued authoritative advice to the nation. ""People should know
the facts,"" Keys told Time magazine. ""Then if they want to eat themselves to
death, let them.""

This apparent certainty was unwarranted: even some supporters of the fat
hypothesis admitted that the evidence for it was still inconclusive. But Keys
held a trump card. From 1958 to 1964, he and his fellow researchers gathered
data on the diets, lifestyles and health of 12,770 middle-aged men, in Italy,
Greece, Yugoslavia, Finland, Netherlands, Japan and the United States. The Seven
Countries Study was finally published as a 211-page monograph in 1970. It showed
a correlation between intake of saturated fats and deaths from heart disease,
just as Keys had predicted. The scientific debate swung decisively behind the
fat hypothesis.

Keys was the original big data guy (a contemporary remarked: ""Every time you
question this man Keys, he says, 'I've got 5,000 cases. How many do you have?').
Despite its monumental stature, however, the Seven Countries Study, which was
the basis for a cascade of subsequent papers by its original authors, was a
rickety construction. There was no objective basis for the countries chosen by
Keys, and it is hard to avoid the conclusion that he picked only those he
suspected would support his hypothesis. After all, it is quite something to
choose seven nations in Europe and leave out France and what was then West
Germany, but then, Keys already knew that the French and Germans had relatively
low rates of heart disease, despite living on a diet rich in saturated fats.

The study's biggest limitation was inherent to its method. Epidemiological
research involves the collection of data on people's behaviour and health, and a
search for patterns. Originally developed to study infection, Keys and his
successors adapted it to the study of chronic diseases, which, unlike most
infections, take decades to develop, and are entangled with hundreds of dietary
and lifestyle factors, effectively impossible to separate.

To reliably identify causes, as opposed to correlations, a higher standard of
evidence is required: the controlled trial. In its simplest form: recruit a
group of subjects, and assign half of them a diet for, say, 15 years. At the end
of the trial, assess the health of those in the intervention group, versus the
control group. This method is also problematic: it is virtually impossible to
closely supervise the diets of large groups of people. But a properly conducted
trial is the only way to conclude with any confidence that X is responsible for
Y.

Although Keys had shown a correlation between heart disease and saturated fat,
he had not excluded the possibility that heart disease was being caused by
something else. Years later, the Seven Countries study's lead Italian
researcher, Alessandro Menotti, went back to the data, and found that the food
that correlated most closely with deaths from heart disease was not saturated
fat, but sugar.

By then it was too late. The Seven Countries study had become canonical, and the
fat hypothesis was enshrined in official advice. The congressional committee
responsible for the original Dietary Guidelines was chaired by Senator George
McGovern. It took most of its evidence from America's nutritional elite: men
from a handful of prestigious universities, most of whom knew or worked with
each other, all of whom agreed that fat was the problem - an assumption that
McGovern and his fellow senators never seriously questioned. Only occasionally
were they asked to reconsider. In 1973, John Yudkin was called from London to
testify before the committee, and presented his alternative theory of heart
disease.

A bemused McGovern asked Yudkin if he was really suggesting that a high fat
intake was not a problem, and that cholesterol presented no danger.

""I believe both those things,"" replied Yudkin.

""That is exactly the opposite of what my doctor told me,"" said McGovern.

* * *

In a 2015 paper titled Does Science Advance One Funeral at a Time?, a team of
scholars at the National Bureau of Economic Research sought an empirical basis
for a remark made by the physicist Max Planck: ""A new scientific truth does not
triumph by convincing its opponents and making them see the light, but rather
because its opponents eventually die, and a new generation grows up that is
familiar with it.""

The researchers identified more than 12,000 ""elite"" scientists from different
fields. The criteria for elite status included funding, number of publications,
and whether they were members of the National Academies of Science or the
Institute of Medicine. Searching obituaries, the team found 452 who had died
before retirement. They then looked to see what happened to the fields from
which these celebrated scientists had unexpectedly departed, by analysing
publishing patterns.

What they found confirmed the truth of Planck's maxim. Junior researchers who
had worked closely with the elite scientists, authoring papers with them,
published less. At the same time, there was a marked increase in papers by
newcomers to the field, who were less likely to cite the work of the deceased
eminence. The articles by these newcomers were substantive and influential,
attracting a high number of citations. They moved the whole field along.

A scientist is part of what the Polish philosopher of science Ludwik Fleck
called a ""thought collective"": a group of people exchanging ideas in a mutually
comprehensible idiom. The group, suggested Fleck, inevitably develops a mind of
its own, as the individuals in it converge on a way of communicating, thinking
and feeling.

This makes scientific inquiry prone to the eternal rules of human social life:
deference to the charismatic, herding towards majority opinion, punishment for
deviance, and intense discomfort with admitting to error. Of course, such
tendencies are precisely what the scientific method was invented to correct for,
and over the long run, it does a good job of it. In the long run, however, we're
all dead, quite possibly sooner than we would be if we hadn't been following a
diet based on poor advice.

* * *

In a series of densely argued articles and books, including Why We Get Fat
(2010), the science writer Gary Taubes has assembled a critique of contemporary
nutrition science, powerful enough to compel the field to listen. One of his
contributions has been to uncover a body of research conducted by German and
Austrian scientists before the second world war, which had been overlooked by
the Americans who reinvented the field in the 1950s. The Europeans were
practising physicians and experts in the metabolic system. The Americans were
more likely to be epidemiologists, labouring in relative ignorance of
biochemistry and endocrinology (the study of hormones). This led to some of the
foundational mistakes of modern nutrition.

The rise and slow fall of cholesterol's infamy is a case in point. After it was
discovered inside the arteries of men who had suffered heart attacks, public
health officials, advised by scientists, put eggs, whose yolks are rich in
cholesterol, on the danger list. But it is a biological error to confuse what a
person puts in their mouth with what it becomes after it is swallowed. The human
body, far from being a passive vessel for whatever we choose to fill it with, is
a busy chemical plant, transforming and redistributing the energy it receives.
Its governing principle is homeostasis, or the maintenance of energy equilibrium
(when exercise heats us up, sweat cools us down). Cholesterol, present in all of
our cells, is created by the liver. Biochemists had long known that the more
cholesterol you eat, the less your liver produces.

| Joanna Blythman

Unsurprisingly, then, repeated attempts to prove a correlation between dietary
cholesterol and blood cholesterol failed. For the vast majority of people,
eating two or three, or 25 eggs a day, does not significantly raise cholesterol
levels. One of the most nutrient-dense, versatile and delicious foods we have
was needlessly stigmatised. The health authorities have spent the last few years
slowly backing away from this mistake, presumably in the hope that if no sudden
movements are made, nobody will notice. In a sense, they have succeeded: a
survey carried out in 2014 by Credit Suisse found that 54% of US doctors believe
that dietary cholesterol raises blood cholesterol.

To his credit, Ancel Keys realised early on that dietary cholesterol was not a
problem. But in order to sustain his assertion that cholesterol causes heart
attacks, he needed to identify an agent that raises its levels in the blood - he
landed on saturated fats. In the 30 years after Eisenhower's heart attack, trial
after trial failed to conclusively bear out the association he claimed to have
identified in the Seven Countries study.

The nutritional establishment wasn't greatly discomfited by the absence of
definitive proof, but by 1993 it found that it couldn't evade another criticism:
while a low-fat diet had been recommended to women, it had never been tested on
them (a fact that is astonishing only if you are not a nutrition scientist). The
National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute decided to go all in, commissioning the
largest controlled trial of diets ever undertaken. As well as addressing the
other half of the population, the Women's Health Initiative was expected to
obliterate any lingering doubts about the ill-effects of fat.

It did nothing of the sort. At the end of the trial, it was found that women on
the low-fat diet were no less likely than the control group to contract cancer
or heart disease. This caused much consternation. The study's principal
researcher, unwilling to accept the implications of his own findings, remarked:
""We are scratching our heads over some of these results."" A consensus quickly
formed that the study - meticulously planned, lavishly funded, overseen by
impressively credentialed researchers - must have been so flawed as to be
meaningless. The field moved on, or rather did not.

In 2008, researchers from Oxford University undertook a Europe-wide study of the
causes of heart disease. Its data shows an inverse correlation between saturated
fat and heart disease, across the continent. France, the country with the
highest intake of saturated fat, has the lowest rate of heart disease; Ukraine,
the country with the lowest intake of saturated fat, has the highest. When the

From app doctors to big data: five ways tech will shape healthcare;
From video conferencing your GP to tracking viral outbreaks of disease, a panel
of experts shared insights into the changing face of healthcare See everything
the experts said here

BYLINE: Hannah Gould

SECTION: GUARDIAN SUSTAINABLE BUSINESS

Technology presents huge opportunities and challenges for our health and care
system. Here are five areas to watch:

Wearables

Shipments of the activity tracking wearable Fitbit are up 25.4% this year,
signalling more and more of us want insights into our exercise, eating, weight
and sleeping patterns.

As we begin to generate our own health data, our relationship with our bodies
will change, and the way we understand and seek healthcare will be transformed.

""Some of my patients will share outputs from their wearable... when it comes to
their yearly reviews. But this is the exception, rather than the rule at
present,"" says Dr Junaid Bajwa, director of healthcare services, MSD.

The challenge is integrating wearable data with existing data to create a single
personal health record.

""Additional data without insight [only] adds to the burden of both clinicians
and patients,"" says Rashmi Narayan, clinical director, uMotif. ""It's about
actionable insight into patient's health rather than sheer volume.""

Wearables can also help manage the symptoms of illnesses. For example, Philips
is currently working on a falls prevention programme. According to Dr Seemit
Dhage, clinical lead on Philips HealthTech, its wearable device uses algorithms
and analytics to predict when a patient might fall.

""Combined with a telehealth solution, we are able to send messages to the right
healthcare professionals who are then able to intervene at an early stage. [It]
also helps us monitor patients who have a known history of falls.""

App doctors

Both developed and developing world countries suffer from a lack of doctors, and
the scale of the problem is so big that only technology can fix it, according to
Matteo Berlucchi, chief executive of digital medical service Your.MD.

Your.MD is a mobile app that uses artificial intelligence (AI) to mimic a
consultation with a GP. It answers three key questions: what is wrong with me?
What is the solution? And where can I get help?

Related:  Will mobile health apps make GPs redundant?

""It's not a matter of replacing doctors but complementing them,"" says Berlucchi.
""Or in other words, taking some of the easier and more mundane situations off
the hands of real doctors and having AI sort them out. A lot of visits to the GP
(as many as three in five) are for minor ailments, advice or things that you
could sort out yourself with over the counter medicines. In these situations,
what the GP gives you is basically 'the right information'.""

With some 165,000 mobile health apps available, however, there is risk that poor
quality ones will cause people to lose trust in health apps as a whole. As
Berlucchi says: ""trust comes on foot and leaves on horseback.""

Telehealth

Many GP interactions are already conducted remotely via phone, but increasingly
thy are happening by video, explains David Furniss, vice-president, global
government and health, BT.

""We are already seeing the development of technology that will allow some vital
signs measurements to be done simultaneously via video at the same time as the
consultation. You wouldn't have all interactions with your GP like this, but in
many cases it's more effective, saves time and travel.""

Big data

Big data will have impacts for both non-communicable diseases (such as asthma
and diabetes), and communicable diseases (such as measles).

The Cloudy with a Chance of Pain project for example, will use data logged by
participants to determine if there is a correlation between weather and chronic
pain. The anonymous data can even be explored by the general public to try and
spot the patterns between weather and symptoms.

The ability of big data to track communicable diseases such as the Zika virus
and travel patterns also has huge potential. Big data and analytics have already
played a role in containing previous viral outbreaks of cholera and malaria. But
it needs support infrastructure at ground level to really work

Berlucchi also points to the potential of deep learning applied to big data. ""It
provides a way to become much more accurate at diagnosing certain conditions.
For example, computers should be better at spotting anomalies in MRIs... [and] a
doctor can then verify what a computer has flagged.""

However there are potential drawbacks of big data. Recent news that Google
received access to the healthcare data of up to 1.6 million patients, sparked
fears over security and privacy.

Digital therapy

The key drivers for digital therapy solutions for conditions such as insomnia,
anxiety and depression are constraints on financial and human resources. Digital
therapy won't be for everyone, but examples include Big White Wall, for peer to
peer mental health support. And pzizz, an app to help people with sleeping
problems.

While apps might be able to respond quickly to the needs of a patient they will
never be especially good at delivering empathy.

""Losing the human touch is a danger,"" says Julie Bretland, director and CEO, Our
Mobile Health. ""But given the current economic pressures on the healthcare
system, we are in danger of losing the humane touch irrespectively. If tech is
integrated in a considerate manner, then it has the potential to be more
inclusive rather than isolating.""

Dr Google will see you now: Alphabet's forays into biotechnology;
The internet giant's partnership with GlaxoSmithKline is the latest in a long
line of projects and experiments in the medical sector

BYLINE: Rob Davies

SECTION: TECHNOLOGY

LENGTH: 751 words


Alphabet's partnership with GlaxoSmithKline is by no means its first foray into
the world of biotechnology. Google's parent also owns Verily Life Sciences,
which works on futuristic projects that marry technology with medicine. Aimed at
tackling everything from relatively minor ailments to cancer, some of its
innovative products are closer to becoming a reality than others.

Smart contact lenses

One of Verily's big-ticket projects is the development of a smart contact lens
designed to help people with diabetes. The prototype contains a wireless chip
and a tiny glucose sensor that monitors the amount of glucose in the user's
tears.

A tiny hole in the lens allows teardrops to seep into the sensor, which
transmits information about the patient's blood-sugar levels, via a minuscule
wireless antenna, to a separate device. Theoretically, the patient's doctor can
then use this information to inform their treatment.

The company is exploring whether it could incorporate into the technology LED
lights that would flash when glucose levels cross a certain threshold, alerting
the user and helping them to manage the condition.

Although Google is working in partnership with Swiss pharmaceuticals firm
Novartis, experts have cast doubt on whether glucose levels in teardrops are an
accurate reflection of blood-sugar levels in the body.

The firms hope smart contact lenses could also be used to correct
long-sightedness, which often occurs in middle or old age.

The 'tricorder'

The Star Trek series featured a handheld electronic device, the tricoder, that
was capable of diagnosing diseases within seconds. Verily has been working on
technology inspired by the tricorder for two years, although progress has been
halting at best.

Under Verily's plans, patients would swallow a pill filled with magnetic
nanoparticles measuring less than one-thousandth the width of a red blood cell.
These could then attach to your body's cells and proteins and transmit data -
such as the existence of cancerous cells - to a wearable device.

Smart spoons

The Liftware spoon is an example of biotechnology that is already being used in
some parts of the healthcare industry.

The spoon is fitted with a vibrating component that helps lessen the effect of
tremors, such as those caused by Parkinson's disease or the more common
essential tremor.

It claims to reduce the effect of tremors by 70% by sensing involuntary
movements and counteracting them. When the user's hand moves to the right, the
spoon moves to the left, and vice versa, allowing patients to feed themselves.
Google bought Lift Labs, the company that invented it, in 2014.

Data diagnostics

Google is working with drugs company Biogen to use its expertise in analysing
large amounts of data to better understand the progress of multiple sclerosis.
The idea is to use sensors to gather information that would help researchers
understand the biological and environmental factors that cause the disease to
progress more quickly in some people than others.

Verily has already developed a health-tracking wristband - similar to the Fitbit
range of exercise devices - that can measure pulse, heart rhythm and skin
temperature. It also monitors environmental information such as light exposure
and noise levels. It hopes that similar technology could be used to gather data
for its research into multiple sclerosis with Biogen.

Big data is also at the heart of Google's Baseline project, a study that is
gathering huge amounts of information about people in order to define what
constitutes health in humans.

Mortality

One of the more fantastical projects in the Alphabet stable is Calico, a
biotechnology company aimed at the medical holy grail - a cure for, or rather
the prevention of, death.

Short for California Life Company, Calico is more circumspect about its aims
than Alphabet's other biotechnology subsidiaries.

Its website says the company's aim is to ""harness advanced technologies to
increase our understanding of the biology that controls lifespan"".

In 2014, Calico announced a partnership with drugs firm AbbVie to investigate
ways to combat ageing and its associated ailments, entailing joint investment

The Guardian view on patient data: we need a better approach;
The deal between an NHS hospital and Google's artificial intelligence division
DeepMind is a cautionary tale for the future use of sensitive data by tech
monopolists

BYLINE: Editorial

SECTION: OPINION; Version:1

LENGTH: 431 words


Any fair-minded assessment of the dangers of the deal between the NHS and
DeepMind must start by acknowledging that both sides mean well. DeepMind, owned
by Google's owners, is one of the leading artificial intelligence outfits in the
world. The potential of this work applied to healthcare is very great. But it
could also lead to further concentration of power in the tech giants. It is
against that background that the information commissioner, Dame Elizabeth
Denham, has issued her damning verdict against the Royal Free hospital trust,
which handed over to DeepMind the records of 1.6 million patients in 2015 on the
basis of a vague agreement which took far too little account of the patients'
rights and their expectations of privacy.

DeepMind has almost apologised. The trust has mended its ways. Further
arrangements - and there may be many - between the NHS and DeepMind will be
carefully scrutinised to ensure that all necessary permissions have been asked
of patients and all unnecessary data has been sanitised. There are lessons about
informed patient consent to learn. But privacy is not the only angle in this
case and not even the most important. Dame Elizabeth chose to concentrate the
blame on the NHS trust, since under existing law it ""controlled"" the data and
DeepMind merely ""processed"" it. But this distinction misses the point that it is
processing and aggregation, not the mere possession of bits, that gives the data
value.

The great question is who should benefit from the analysis of all the data that
our lives now generate. Privacy law builds on the concept of damage to an
individual from identifiable knowledge about them. That misses the way the
surveillance economy works. The data of an individual there gains its value only
when it is compared with the data of countless millions more.

The use of privacy law to curb the tech giants in this instance, or of
competition law in the case of the EU's dispute with Google, both feel slightly
maladapted. They do not address the real worry. It is not enough to say that the
algorithms DeepMind develops will benefit patients and save lives. What matters
is that they will belong to a private monopoly which developed them using public
resources. If software promises to save lives on the scale that drugs now can,
big data may be expected to behave as big pharma has done. We are still at the
beginning of this revolution and small choices now may turn out to have gigantic
consequences later. A"

Technophobes can relax - there's no such thing as the fourth industrial
revolution;
One model estimates that 85 per cent of the economic limit of technology has
been reached, projected to reach 95 per cent by 2038

BYLINE: Satyajit Das

SECTION: VOICES

LENGTH: 1680 words


The theme of the 2016 World Economic Forum (""WEF"") in Davos was the ""Fourth
Industrial Revolution"". Professor Klaus Schwab, WEF's founder, has even
published a hasty, crowd-sourced book. He warns that the scale, speed and impact
of new technologies, focused on artificial intelligence, robotics, the Internet
of things, autonomous vehicles, 3D printing, blockchains and biotechnology, are
""so profound"" that in history ""there has never been a time of greater promise or
potential peril"".

Of course, Davos men and women are confident that the promise will prevail,
ushering in a new period of development and prosperity. Over human history,
progress in technology has been linked to improvements in living standards. But
there are reasons to question whether this new phase ofinnovation will be as
influential as presented.

The Fourth Industrial Revolution follows on from earlier periods of innovation.
Economist Robert Gordon defines these phases as follows: the First Industrial
Revolution 1 (1750-1830) focused on coal, steam engines, railroads and textiles;
the Second Industrial Revolution (1870-1900) entaileddevelopments in
electricity, internal combustion engines, modern communications, entertainment,
petroleum/hydro-carbons and chemicals; and the Third Industrial Revolution (1960
to the present) has revolved around computing and telecommunications.

The impact of any sustained period of innovation on economic activity depends
on: the quantum of the change; the effect on growth and productivity; its
longevity, dispersion and long term evolution. Professor Gordon found that the
Second Industrial Revolution had the most impact on productivity and living
standards. The follow-on period lasted in excess of 100 years, as the full
potential of the innovations were realised.

Electricity and the internal combustion engines illustrate the scale of the
change. Built upon existing scientific foundations, electricity became
commercially viable around 1880. Since then it has been the preferred source of
energy, unmatched in terms of conversion efficiency, different fuels,
productivity, transportability, precise control of delivery and flexibility.
Internal combustion engines allied to availability of oil revolutionised
transport and industry. By replacing animals or humans, it increased power,
speed, reduced cost, improved efficiency as well as removing the problem of
dealing with unsanitary animal waste.

Crucially, the major innovations created large industries, both directly and
indirectly. The internal combustion engine allowed the creation of automobiles,
which in turn drove development and expansion of the steel, aluminium andrubber
industries, supply and distribution of gasoline and oil products, infrastructure
for maintenance of vehicles and, most significantly, road systems. These
industries were each significant in scale and also created substantial
employment opportunities with sufficient wages to drive demand for cars
themselves.

The impact is evident by comparing changes in ordinary life between 1870 and
1970, by which time the innovations of the Second Industrial Revolution had been
fully exploited, and 1970 to today. A modern individual would recognise the
world of 1970 as familiar, though perhaps basic in terms of work, houses,
sanitation, energy sources, transport, entertainment and household appliances.
In contrast, a 1970 individual would not recognise the primitive world of 1870.

The large-scale changes of the Second Industrial Revolution may have been a
one-time event, driving non-repeatable increases in living standards.

The era of the socialist experiment is over

The Third Industrial Revolution (1960 to the present) has not been as
significant as hoped for. The much-touted Fourth Industrial Revolution is a
continuation of the Third. Many elements -Artificial Intelligence, Robotics,
biotechnology -are not new.

Techno-optimists dismiss fears about slowing innovation, typecasting
non-believers as Luddites. The impact of recent technological changes, they
believe, will be realised over time. Techno-optimists believe that progress is
near a singularity, the hypothetical moment when artificial intelligence will
have progressed to the point of a greater-than-human intelligence with radical
implications for human beings and society.

Luddites point to the weaknesses in the technology, such as Big Data, robotics,
3D manufacturing and new wonder drugs.

Big data uses inductive statistics and nonlinear system tools on large data sets
to measure and establish relationships, dependencies and identify trends.The
technology remains unproven. Its predictive powers are highly variable,
reflecting assumptions about data properties that in practice are not well
understood.

To date, it has been used mainly in epidemiology, assessing insurance risks or
targeted marketing. Big data requires big money, big assumptions and entails big
judgemental risks. It has the same problems as all analysis, with more data
merely creating new problems rather than providing solutions.

Big data also faces the problem of access to information. Concerns about privacy
and security have led to greater use of encryption, which reduces the scope of
products and business models which rely on capturing and extracting value from
data.

Big data is not new. Its origins are in security and surveillance techniques
used extensively by intelligence agencies such as the NSA. Repeated intelligence
failures highlight the fact that capturing data is easier then interpreting it.
Technology which has the ability to capture exabytes of data rapidly overwhelms
analytical capabilities.

Big data resembles Jorge Luis Borges' Library of Babel, where the world's entire
knowledge is stored. However, not a single word is understood or intelligible in
a ""labyrinth of letters....[containing] senseless cacophonies, verbal jumbles
and incoherences"".

Robotic technology is already extensively used in manufacturing, especially of
motor vehicles. Robots designed for healthcare are attracting interest. Despite
advances, they remain restricted in terms of power source, locomotion,
manipulation and sensory perception, limiting their use for non-routine tasks.
Robots have had difficulty completing simple, routine human tasks, such as
sorting washing.

First suggested twenty years ago, 3D or additive manufacturing is a process in
which successive layers of material are placed under computer control to create
three-dimensional objects. It may prove to be a valuable niche product, reducing
the cost of manufacturing single or small-run items where there are no economies
of scale.

Luddites point to technology as a source of problems. Technologies such as the
internal combustion engine and fossil fuels have been highly influential but lie
at the heart of environmental damage, which must be dealt with.

The unintended effects of new technology are also problematic. Sophisticated
cyber attacks, malware and computer viruses cause chaos, disruption, data or
financial loss and personally or politically humiliating public disclosures. The
cost of preventing these activities is considerable. Security, trust and privacy
are compromised. Bot fraud, where computer programs artificially create page
views of online advertising, costs advertisers over $6 billion annually and
constitutes up to 25 per cent of hits.

Overuse of antibiotics has increased drug resistant infections, which a 2014
British study found may cause 10 million deaths a year worldwide by 2050. The
potential cost is $100 trillion, reducing GDP by 3.5 per cent.

Luddites point to scientific and economic limits to technology. The number of
new patents is not commensurate with billions of research dollars. Gains in life
expectancy have slowed. Medical advances have disappointed, with cures to many
diseases such as cancer proving elusive. Scientists have a saying: nuclear
fusion is 30 years away and always be.

One model suggests that the rate of innovation per capita peaked in 1873 and has
declined subsequently. It estimates that 85 per cent of the economic limit of
technology has been reached, projected to reach 95 per cent by 2038.

Important opportunities for innovation remain; improving crop yields to feed the
planet, developing cheap, sustainable sources of energy and electricity storage,
treating simple and deadly diseases, conserving scarce commodities and improving
logistics to use existing resources efficiently. The current technological focus
is with some exceptions not focused on these issues.

In his Theses on the Philosophy of History, Walter Benjamin describes the Turk,
a dazzling chess playing machine devised by Baron Wolfgang von Kemplen: ""an
automaton constructed in such a way that it could play a winning game of chess,
answering each move of an opponent with a countermove"". The device featured a
puppet in Turkish attire and with a hookah in its mouth sitting before the
chessboard. A system of mirrors created the illusion that this table was
transparent from all sides. Actually a little hunchback who was an expert chess
player sat inside and guided the puppet's hand by means of strings. Benjamin
used the story, which was based on fact, to unveil a historical deception.
Rather than a miracle of technology and science, the machine was an elaborate
hoax animated by a different force.

Today, the world's focus on technology and innovation is driven by a desperate
desire to find a magical solution to the economic and related social and
political problems confronting the human race. While there are many important
problems to be solved, and whileinnovations will continue in many fields, there
is an unreasonable expectation that dramatic changes and innovations, at least
on the scale of the industrial or early computing revolutions, are on the
horizon.

Have you heard the one about the Chinese mobile phone factory that made one
change and increased productivity by 250 per cent?

In news that won't have been very funny to employees, the Changying Precision
Technology replaced 90 per cent of its human workforce with machines.

The workforce at the factory in Dongguan City shrank from 650 people to just 60
after the company invested in 60 robot arms that can work 24 hours a day across
10 production lines. Luo Weiqiang, general manager of the factory, says the
number of employees could be reduced to just 20.

Robots and AI are threatening close to a third of UK jobs

Factory jobs are the most obvious casualty in the march towards automation.
Almost half of all the manufacturing jobs in the UK could soon be done by
machines. Transport and retail jobs will also be transformed in ways that are
not beyond the imagination for anyone who has used a self-checkout at a
supermarket or been following Tesla's experiments with driverless cars.

Beyond the 30 per cent of UK jobs that are expected to be replaced by machines
by 2030, artificial intelligence is creeping into otherless likelyindustries.
Professions once considered essentially human are employing robots to complement
human judgement, opening up opportunities for startups.

Euan Cameron, leader of artificial intelligence at PwC UK, says computers are
good at jobs that are composed of different tasks. ""They are good at locating
knowledge, recognising patterns, understanding natural language and continuous
learning,"" he says.

They are less good at jobs with characteristics that are seen as uniquely human
like common sense, morality, creativity, ethics and emotional intelligence.
""Most jobs are a combination of those. So the extent to which a job will be
disrupted depends,""Cameron says.

Industries including teaching, law and medicine have become a battleground for
startups and investors. They are eager to disrupt first with technology like
WriteLab, an online writing coach, or Redox, which helps organisations share
healthcare data.

Luminance is a start-up that using computers to process large data sets to help
lawyers and law firms do due diligence on contracts. At the moment, contracts
are reviewed by newly-qualified lawyers who spend long hours over late nights
and weekends reading hundreds of pages, a process which can be complicated by
tiredness and errors.

Emily Foges, Luminance's chief executive, says the company allows junior and
trainee lawyers get back to more interesting work analysing the data as they did
before contracts were drawn up digitally, producing hundreds, possibly thousands
of digital documents.

""Trying to find clauses is like going through a needle in a haystack,""
Fogessays. ""The process of due diligence is no longer fit for purpose. The idea
that you can read everything about a contract and a company in a few weeks is no
longer possible.""

Computers, however, are excellent at spotting anomalies in datasets more quickly
than humans can. It might identify a missing clause in a contract that can then
be added in by the lawyer. Luminance says this process doesn't replace the role
of lawyers but helps them to categorise, review and analyst the documents,
improving efficiency by at least 50 per cent.

Artificial intelligence can also help ordinary people to do work that once
required legal training. DoNotPay is an app that was created by Joshua Bowder, a
20-year-old Stanford University student from London. It acts as a paralegal
service, helping drivers dispute parking tickets by giving everyone the same
legal access. The online bot has helped overturn more than 200,000 parking
tickets in London, New York and Seattle.

It is harder to convince people of the case for artificial intelligence in
professions like teaching and medicine, which require higher levels of emotional
intelligence.

Cameron says one problem is the ambiguity of the term. Artificial intelligence
is essentially about using machines to do things normally associated with human
capabilities. ""That almost always has a learning element to it, whether that
involves learning data, insights or judgement. Judgement tends to be what people
are nervous about delegating,"" he says.

Teachers, for example, are valued for their pastoral role with children,
comforting and guiding as they grow.

AI could cut the hours teachers spend on paperwork, planning and assessment or
transform the way lessons are delivered, so the child does the bulk of the work
at home and exercises with the teacher in the classroom.

""AI devices can monitor the behaviour of the child, such as which answers they
are getting right and wrong, which questions they are selecting. Then you have
this data for what kind of interventions are needed in terms of additional
modules,""Cameron says.

There are privacy concerns about collecting data this way. A pilot by a company
called

InBloom

in New York in 2014 collapsed after it ran into issues.

Confidentiality is an even bigger issue in healthcare. As is trust: patients are
likely to be unsure about the idea of robots conducting surgery for now. ""In
medicine you need a bedside manner,""Cameron says.

""But behind the scenes clinicians are performing diagnosis where the assistance
of an AI agent can improve the quality and efficiency.""

A computer's ability to spot anomalies in data can help clinicians identify
unusual signs and symptoms in patients better. ""A clinician can do a pretty good
jobs and a trained computer can do a good job but together they can do an even
better job,"" Cameron adds.

Ursula Huws, professor of labour and globalisation at the University of
Hertfordshire, says that while it is true that artificial intelligence will
replace some jobs, it will also create jobs, like those at startups developing
the technology. ""As fast as you have jobs disappearing because of automation,
you have new jobs to make the robots, clean the robots, deliver them, mine the
raw materials,""Huws says.

Cameron agrees that the number of jobs in the marketplace will stay broadly flat
as artificial intelligence develops, but adds that the technology should provide
a boost to the economy by increasing productivity. ""The overall economic impact
will be beneficial,"" he says.

Tictrac: the startup that wants to help solve the self care crisis;
The platformaims to pull in material from over a thousand devices to help users
better understand connected trends in their behaviour

BYLINE: Miles Dilworth

SECTION: INDYVENTURE; Version:1

LENGTH: 824 words


Tictrac CEO and founder Martin Blinder may be a digital entrepreneur, but you'd
be forgiven for thinking of him as a man hankering for a job as health minister.

After globe-trotting through the consumer web industry for over 15 years, in
countries including Spain and the US, Argentina-born Mr Blinder founded
London-based startup Tictrac in 2010 as a lifestyle platform.

Originally, it was designed to help people improve every element of their lives
- from physical wellbeing to their relationships. But in 2012, Tictrac won a
major industry award at a health tech conference and Mr Blinder subsequently
decided to focus on providing a service specifically for people looking to
become healthier.

""The biggest challenge in healthcare is about making sure people take
responsibility for their own health,"" says Mr Blinder. ""A lot of us feel
somewhat entitled to healthcare, that someone else will take care of us.""

He thinks that, if we want a health system that actually works, we need to stop
shifting responsibility.

""People need to start taking a greater degree of accountability for their own
health,"" he says.

If what Mr Blinder is saying sounds familiar, then that's probably because we've
heard it before. The NHS calls it ""patient activation"" - a buzzword for their
five-year plan to help people take better care of their own health and alleviate
the burden on the health service.

Mr Blinder's phrase, ""empowering and engaging people in their health through
their data"", is not quite as punchy, but it's got the same goal in mind. And it
is not necessarily a new idea. The notion of coupling technology with
self-improvement was spawned in San Francisco in 2007 by journalist Gary Wolf's
blog the ""Quantified Self"".

Tictrac's core function - helping people monitor and improve health habits
through data tracking - is replicated by countless other apps. But itsays that
it differentiates itself by offering to aggregate the information collected by
those separate gadgets and turning it all into one big data dashboard.

It can be downloaded to a phone for free and has the capacity to connect to over
a thousand other devices.Tictrac aims to pull in material from the Fitbits,
Runkeepers and Apple watches of this world to enable users to understand
connected trends in their behaviour. The example Mr Blinder uses is the
possibility of correlating a lack of sleep or high blood pressure with an
overloaded email inbox.

'People need to start taking a greater degree of accountability for their own
health,'says

Tictrac

CEO and founder Martin Blinder (

)

To simplify the data crunching, users set specific goals, such as weight loss,
and choose the information they want Tictrac to evaluate. The platform then sets
small challenges, such as walking for half an hour a day, that users accrue
health points by completing.

A simple self-improvement tool for some, but Mr Blinder has his sights on bigger
targets; his current crusade is diabetes prevention. Tictrac is working with
health insurers across the US to tackle the disease by identifying potentially
vulnerable users and recommending appropriate action plans. It is doing
something similar with the Ministry of Health in Singapore, where all 4 million
citizens have access to the platform.

So would Tictrac push for a similar partnership with the NHS? ""Possibly,"" says
Mr Blinder, although he proceeds to mumble something pessimistic about
bureaucracy.

The mission sounds worthy, but its success is as yet unknown. Mr Blinder is
cagey on evidence that the platform actually helps reduce rates of diabetes and
is only willing to say that ""Tictrac has clear success markers for weight
reduction, sleep improvement and other health indicators associated with type 2
diabetes"".Essentially, testing is ongoing.

Could the platform's analytics be used to evaluate national trends for diseases

And do people really need a ""digital health platform"" to tell them to drink less
and exercise regularly? The answer to that question, at least, seems to be
'yes'. The Quantified Self Conference, hosted by Mr Wolf's pioneering company of

their stories of miraculous health improvements thanks to personal analytics
platforms.

Tictrac itself is gaining traction too. Itrakedin $5.3m in funding from its

The demand is real, but whether or not Tictrac can achieve its higher ambition
of solving the self-care crisis remains to be seen.

NHS will monitor Facebook for comment about hospitals, says new CQC head;
Peter Wyman, the new chairman of the Care Quality Commission, sets out his plans
for an overhaul of the health service regulator

BYLINE: By Laura Donnelly Health Editor

SECTION: NEWS

NHS watchdogs will trawl Facebook for negative comments about hospitals and
intervene to check their patients are safe, the new head of the health service
regulator has said.

In his first interview since being appointed as chairman of the Care Quality
Commission, Peter Wyman set out plans for an overhaul of inspection to make
better use of ""early intelligence"" signalling potential problems.

He said the watchdog needed to make better use of official data, such as
mortality statistics, while being more responsive to anecdotal concerns -
including those expressed on social media.

The current system, which awards Ofsted-style ratings to hospitals, care homes
and GP services, was introduced in the wake of a series of scandals, including
that at Morecambe Bay, where unchecked failings led to a string of baby deaths.

Mr Wyman said the watchdog needed to find ways to intervene more quickly when
alarm bells rang, making use of modern technology to do so. ""There are an awful
lot of ways to capture what people are saying - it could be what people are
saying on Facebook, it could be formal patient complaints, it could be what
Healthwatch [local patient groups] are saying,"" he said.

""If you have got a maternity unit which was good when we last inspected and
suddenly you get staff and the public saying they aren't happy then that is the
time to be asking questions, rather than waiting for something awful to happen
to mothers and babies,"" he said.

The former hospital chairman said the regulator should collect and analyse far
more information about health services.

""We live in a world of big data, we need to be able to capture it and analyse it
intelligently,"" he said.

""A lot of hospitals are using social media in different ways. There is great
potential there to capture people's views,"" he said, suggesting that better use
of ""early intelligence"" was the most crucial change planned in the regulator's
strategy.

The healthcare sector has proved to be  an area of rich returns since the
financial crisis.

Axa Framlington Health, one of the biggest and best-known funds in the sector,
has returned 106pc over the past five years, according to data providers FE

The fund invests globally across the entirety of the healthcare sector,
incorporating pharmaceuticals, medical devices, healthcare services,  biotech

As with other growth funds, the main aim is to identify companies where earnings
are set to grow. If you can buy them at a reasonable price, better still.

In line with the sector, the fund has struggled since early 2015, falling 6pc
over the past year, but three-year returns sit at a healthy 53pc.

Tech and talent must top the next government's wishlist

BYLINE: By Jeremy Hand

SECTION: BUSINESS; Version:1

LENGTH: 1028 words


When the British public votes in the General Election on June 8, it will be
selecting a government to negotiate the UK's departure from the European Union.

The new government will also have responsibility for ensuring that the
productivity of our economy improves by supporting UK-based entrepreneurs and
fostering an environment that cultivates innovation, talent and investment.

The Fourth Industrial revolution (4IR) is characterised by the accelerating
application of automation and connectivity, exemplified by the latest
technologies, such as robotics, Artificial Intelligence, nanotechnology,
driverless cars, the Internet of Things, 3D printing and quantum computing.

Like earlier industrial revolutions - the adoption of the spinning jenny and
steam engine in the 18th century; the combustion engine and the light bulb in
the 19th; and a shift to digitisation in the late 20th century including PCs,
mobile phones and the internet - the 4IR brings with it a period of enormous
economic, social and political disruption.

Silicon Valley-originated inventions, like Google Glass, as well as sci-fi TV
drama series such as Humans with its storyline about anthropomorphic robots,
have captured the public imagination. But it is in everyday applications and
everyday life where 4IR is making its most dramatic impact.

The incremental adoption and creative application of new technologies and new
processes are transforming the way businesses of all sizes and across sectors
operate, manufacture, market and sell. And in turn, incremental changes are
shaping and sometimes disrupting the way customers and service users behave.

Machine-to-Machine communication and the Internet of Things (IOT) may be hidden
from view but have helped improve the quality of our lives in myriad ways, while
improving efficiency and reducing costs. This applies throughout the
manufacturing process.

But think also of greenhouse monitoring, tele-medicine, smart power grids,
security systems and smart homes. And the IOT creates new revenue opportunities
in retail for example, by tracking footfall and measuring customer behaviours.

Machine-to-Machine communication and the Internet of Things have helped to
create smart homes

Improvements in data processing and data storage are making ""Big Data"" a
reality. Predictive and user analytics are helping businesses make better
informed decisions from managing supply chains to segmenting markets - while
measuring risk and performance ever more accurately. All of these innovations
combine to power productivity and growth.

When we at Lyceum Capital invested in Belfast-based digital workforce management
software provider Totalmobile in late 2015, it tapped into growing demand for
improved communications with mobile workers. By supplying employees with a
tablet device running Totalmobile software, organisations such as
Buckinghamshire Healthcare NHS Trust are now able to ensure that the right
frontline nurse is in the right place at the right time with exactly the right
information at their fingertips.

And with a typical mobile healthcare worker needing to access and update
multiple legacy software systems over the course of a typical working week -
from patient records to logistics to HR systems - Totalmobile's use of Big Data
and Artificially Intelligent algorithms ensure better healthcare outcomes and
improve patient and staff satisfaction, while freeing up time and saving cost.

In the race for international tech talent and inward investment, the UK ranks
third in Europe behind Finland and Sweden for digital inclusion and skills (EC
Digital Economy and Society Index - DESI). But the new government should not
forget that around half of our most valuable tech workers hail from overseas
with some 30pc coming from the EU and 20pc from further afield. To avoid a
post-Brexit brain drain, the UK must remain a destination for international
talent, with an immigration policy to match.

And to ensure that in the future more of our tech capability is grown at home
with jobs filled by British citizens, the next government must ?do even more to
encourage the ?take up of science, technology, engineering and maths (STEM)
subjects in schools.

Of the 320,000 students in England studying for A-levels last year, the number
taking STEM subjects was largely stable, according to Department for Education
data. Where it is increasing, it is in tiny increments.

The number of students taking STEM subjects is only increasing by small amounts

Last year, the number of students entered for A-level computing increased by
just 0.3 pc to 1.7 pc. And the 23.8 pc of A-level students entered for
mathematics represented an increase of just 0.5 pc. STEM subjects need to move
further up the education agenda accompanied by more support for targeted
vocational training and apprenticeships.

Continued investment in infrastructure to support an increasingly digitised
marketplace is also vital. Applications and productivity gains requiring
world-class connectivity can only gather momentum if the physical backbone is
there to provide the necessary support.

The last government's ""Universal Service Obligation"" aimed to give every
business and individual in the country the right to request an affordable
high-speed broadband connection. The intention was laudable, but in practice
today the UK ranks no higher than sixth for overall European connectivity and
just 10th for Next Generation Access. Further investment in digital
infrastructure should remain a key priority for the next government.

The UK is the fifth largest global economy and renowned for innovation and our
entrepreneurial spirit. We are home to many world class businesses spanning
technology, hi-tech engineering and pharma research, financial services, the
professions, education and the creative arts. Government initiatives to
cultivate the smartest talent and encourage the right investment will help
capitalise on these strengths and accelerate our position at the vanguard of the
4IR.

The world was Toby Norman's oyster when he started Simprints, a technology
company created to match people to their digital healthcare records. Born in
Switzerland to English parents, he had completed his education in the United
States, studying for his undergraduate and master's degrees at Harvard and from
there might have been expected to head west, to Silicon Valley and California,
or at least New York. In fact, he headed back across the Pond.

For him, Cambridge was the obvious launching pad for his business. ""We thought
pretty hard about moving to the west coast of the US or moving down to London.""
Yet, Mr Norman said, Cambridge held a unique appeal. ""The access to technology
is unparallelled, as is the access to really talented software developers.""
Furthermore, its reputation as a centre of research excellence plays well on the
world stage. ""Having that academic credibility when we're talking to the World
Health Organisation or the World Bank is really valuable.""

Simprints, whose technology will be rolled out to 2.5 million people in the
developing world by the end of next year, forms part of the high-tech Silicon
Fen cluster that has put Cambridge on the map as a global centre of innovation.

Serious money Mark Atherton asks the experts to identify the key companies of

This month the FTSE 100 index of leading companies underwent one of its regular
reinventions: Inmarsat, the satellite communications company, left the index,
while Segro, the property company, joined.

These substitutions reflect a broader trend that every investor should note. You
need to be able to spot the stars of the future, rather than relying on
established names. That was the message of John Kay, a visiting professor of
economics at the London School of Economics, in a speech to guests of the
People's Trust, a customer-owned investment fund due to launch this year.

How the stock markets have changed The 1900 list was dominated by mining
companies such as Rio Tinto and Consolidated Goldfields, with Standard Oil in
the top spot.

By 1956 resource stocks had been swept aside by the rise of manufacturing giants
led by General Motors, Ford and Chrysler, along with US Steel, Inland Steel and
Bethlehem Steel.

Fast-forward another 60 years to 2017 and the picture has changed radically.
Five of the top six places are taken by US technology stocks, led by Apple,
Alphabet (formerly Google) and Microsoft. For the first time a Chinese internet
stock - Alibaba - has made it into the top ten.

What the changes mean for investors Today's companies are far less
capitalintensive than their predecessors. Car manufacturing, drilling for oil,
and steel production require large amounts of capital for not very spectacular
returns, whereas running an internet retailer or a software designer needs very
little capital.

James Anderson, a manager of Scottish Mortgage, the UK's largest global
investment trust (which joined the FTSE 100 in March), says that utilities and
traditional carmakers face ""inevitable decline"".

So what are the industries of the future? Mr Anderson highlights electric cars,
gene sequencing and micro-electronics. He thinks Tesla, the electric car and
energy storage company, could become the most valuable company in the world.
Tesla recently overtook Ford and General Motors in the size of its market
capitalisation, although it made only 80,000 vehicles last year compared with
Ford's 6.7 million.

Another favoured stock is Illumina, the gene sequencing company, which Mr
Anderson thinks could provide the technology for a big leap forward in
healthcare treatment, even though the path has not always been smooth.

Henna Hemnani of the Miton Group's multi-asset fund team says healthcare
technology companies, with their rapid advances in the use of big data, remote
patient monitoring and robotic surgery, are poised to challenge the large
pharmaceutical companies, with their high costs and layers of bureaucracy, Ryan
Smith of Kames Global Sustainable Equity fund picks out electronic payments as
an industry that is driving rapid change as the world moves towards an
increasingly cashless society. He says that Alphabet and Vantiv, the integrated
payment processor, are among the leaders in this field. ""Alphabet's peer-to-peer
payments service, Google Wallet, allows users to send and receive money from
their mobile or desktop computer with no cost to either sender or receiver,"" Mr
Smith says. ""Vantiv covers the whole electronic payments chain.""

Facebook and Tencent, the Chinese internet giant with a host of different
businesses, are set to grow even bigger, according to Ali Unwin, the manager of
the Neptune Global Technology fund.

Tencent's WeChat messaging operation allows you to build a profile, post
pictures and contact friends online, but you can also pay a bill, order a taxi
or carry out a variety of other tasks.

Facebook is achieving similar dominance in social media in the US, says Mr
Unwin. There are about 1.9 billion Facebook users and last year Facebook
generated $11.7 billion ("

Live Longer;
Growth in life expectancy is stalling. The solution is spending more on quantum
computer modelling of the brain to help combat dementia

SECTION: EDITORIAL; OPINION; LEADING ARTICLES; Pg. 31

LENGTH: 644 words


Life is being truncated. After a century of steady increase, the rate of growth
of average UK life expectancy is, according to Sir Michael Marmot of the
Institute of Health Equity, ""grinding to a halt"". More troubling still, if
current trends continue, average British lifespans will soon start getting
shorter. Consternation in the NHS and among the taxpayers who fund it will be
matched only by relief in the pensions industry.

The slowing growth of life expectancy dates from 2009, between the financial
crisis and the coalition government. It coincides roughly with the slowdown in
the growth of health spending but is not necessarily a result of it. The
citizens of other countries that spend less than Britain on health, or similar
amounts, live longer lives.

What is clear is that the slowdown overlaps with a marked increase in mortality
from dementia. Part of this increase is a result of improving survival rates for
other once-dominant causes of death, especially heart disease and cancer. But
even allowing for these, the death rate from dementia is rising. The cost of
caring for those living with it has risen still faster, to "

THE SHAPE OF THINGS TO COME: TOBY WALSH'S TOP TEN PREDICTIONS

1 you see the doctor daily You will be getting medical advice from a doctor
every day - and not because you're a hypochondriac. That doctor will be your
computer. Much of the technology for this is already available, but hasn't been
integrated yet. Your fitness watch will monitor many of your vital statistics:
your pulse, your blood pressure, your sugar levels, your sleep and your
exercise. It will watch for falls and call for help if you faint. Your toilet
will analyse your urine and stool. Your smartphone will take selfies of you to
identify suspect melanomas, and monitor the health of your eyes.

Your computer will also be on the lookout for early signs of dementia. It will
record your voice, identifying changes that indicate a cold, Parkinson's or even
a stroke. All of this will be monitored by an AI program that follows you over
your lifetime, maintaining a daily record of your health, diagnosing many simple
health problems and calling in the experts when there are larger problems to be
explored.

By 2050, many of us will have had our genes sequenced, so that we can identify
our genetic risks. It will be cheap and easy to do; many young people will have
their genes sequenced in utero. Your personal AI doctor will watch for the
diseases to which you are prone. It will have your life history, it will know
far more about medicine than any single doctor, it will stay on top of all the
emerging medical literature - and it is likely to be a trillion-dollar industry.

2 Marilyn Monroe is back in the movies Of course, it won't be the real Marilyn
but an avatar programmed to talk and act just like her. The movie will be
completely interactive and you will star in it. Where the story goes will depend
on what you do or say. Hollywood and the computer games industry will merge, and
movies will immerse you in a hyperreal world. This will be the entertainment
industry.

But there will be concerns about this merging of the real and the virtual. We
will spend more and more of our time in worlds that don't and can't exist -
worlds that will be very seductive. In them, we can all be rich and famous. We
can all be beautiful and smart. People may become addicted to escaping reality -
and because these worlds are not real, there will be those who inhabit them in
order to act in ways that are not acceptable in the real world. There will be
calls for illegal behaviours in the real world to be made illegal or impossible
in the virtual. Others will counter that such virtual worlds provide a necessary
safety valve. It is a dilemma that will trouble our society greatly.

3 A computer hires and fires you I wouldn't be surprised if, in some dark corner
of the Googleplex, this isn't already true. We already trust them to match us
with a partner - and there is an argument that matching people with jobs is
easier to do than matching people with each other. Objective evidence such as
qualifications and past experience are a good indicator of someone's suitability
for a job.

employment. Programs will schedule your activities, approve your holidays, as
well as monitor and reward your performance. In December 2016, Bridgewater

Drug Industry Bets Big On Precision Medicine:
Five Trends Shaping Care Delivery

Drug Industry Bets Big On Precision Medicine: Five Trends Shaping Care Delivery
 
Reenita Das , CONTRIBUTOR

The Death Of ""One Size Fits Many"" Care Models

Precision medicine promises a paradigm shift in care delivery, one that removes the need for guesswork, variable diagnoses and treatment strategies based on generalized demographics. Precision medicine approaches are enabled by data leveraged from direct and indirect sources to provide a more holistic view of an individual patient. Applying precision medicine into mainstream clinical workflow will eventually facilitate more predictive and preventive care by bringing better targeted therapies. By augmenting the process for differential diagnosis, clinicians can mitigate many of the inefficiencies that currently encumber care optimization. Those inefficiencies such as false positives, false negatives, unnecessary treatments and over- or under-medication all have financial and quality-of-care ramifications. Figure 1 shows the paradigm shift in treatment approaches:


It is important to note that in many cases these new models are not just dependent on investments in new systems and technologies. In fact, approaches being explored by leading institutions involve leveraging many existing information sources and technologies and applying them in new ways. Today we will take a look at five key trends shaping this transformation.


1. Unreasonable cost of trial-and-error medicine makes precision medicine imperative for targeted therapies

Rising pressures to decrease healthcare costs globally, the emergence of value-based reimbursement models and healthcare digitization trends are transitioning medication models from ""one-size-fits-all"" to stratified and outcome-based targeted therapies. As a recent article in Nature noted, an estimated 90% of the conventional and top-selling blockbuster medicines only work for 30% to 50% of patients. What is even worse is the side effects and adverse reactions caused by these imprecise medications, accounting for 30% of acute hospital admissions every year. In order to mitigate these inefficiencies, health authorities are introducing transparency measures around drug pricing and deploying sophisticated outcome-based compensation models for consumer-centric targeted therapies. Entailing these trends, pressures such as declining research and development (R&D) productivity and eroding operating margins are also forcing pharmaceutical companies to review their traditional blockbuster business model and consider further strategies such as precision medicine to augment their current areas of focus and open up new revenue streams. Precision medicine involving multi-level patient stratification holds the promise of optimizing the cost, time and success rate of pharma clinical trials by co-developing drug medical prescription (Rx) and diagnostics (Dx) for future targeted therapies.

Today, the drug development industry is betting heavily on precision medicine. Leading pharma/biopharma companies have nearly doubled their investment in personalized medicines in the last five years, and expect an additional 1/3 increase over the next five years. This has created a sense of increased commitment toward personalized medicine across leading pharma competitors, irrespective of their current drug pipeline portfolio. In addition, according to the Tufts Center for the Study of Drug Development (CSDD)"

Deep Learning, Big Data Fuel Medical Device for Predicting Seizures
A deep learning device can accurately predict epileptic seizures using large, longitudinal datasets and could reduce disease burdens for patients with epilepsy.
A medical device using deep learning and big data predicts seizures


By Jessica Kent    


February 01, 2018 - A medical device using deep learning to analyze long-term neural data could effectively predict seizures in patients with epilepsy and reduce their disease burden, according to a study published in eBioMedicine.

Developing accurate and reliable predictive analytics for seizures is a challenge, the team points out, given that the neurological signals related to seizures are highly specific to individuals and can be subject to change.

Deep learning, a machine learning technique that mimics the decision-making structure of the human brain, provides a potential solution to the uncertainty that can burden epilepsy patients.

To test their theory, researchers developed an automated epileptic seizure prediction system that would allow patients to directly tune its sensitivity. The system would classify incoming data segments as either preictal (time before a seizure) or interictal (time between seizures) and compared its performance to that of a random predictor.

Researchers then deployed the prediction system onto a low-power computer chip that could be installed into a wearable device such as a watch or bracelet.

The team found that the prediction system achieved a mean sensitivity of 68.6 percent and spent an average of 26.9 percent of the time in the warning state, which significantly outperformed the equivalent random predictor for all patients by 42.3 percent.

The prediction system outperformed a random predictor by 41.3 percent after it was deployed onto the chip. It also showed an average sensitivity of 71.7 percent and spent an average of 31.7 percent of time in the warning state.

The model also allows clinicians and patients to set individual preferences regarding sensitivity, as well as the duration and number of alarms, which is a feature that isn"
